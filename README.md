# Machine-Learning-Notes
This are the hands-on notes of machine learning with python . 
Notes reference are taken from the course Machine Learning with python IBM by coursera :- https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python

In this notes , the basic concepts of machine learning like clustering,classification etc. are explained with screenshots.Also the concepts are explained with the hands-on coding in python.
By this you will get a general overview of Machine Learning topics such as supervised vs unsupervised learning,  model evaluation, and Machine Learning algorithms.
